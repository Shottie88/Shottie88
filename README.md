- Hi my name is Shottie, I have been a system adminstrator(Linux/Windows) for 15 years.
- I am starting on a journey to learn some perl scripting and maybe do some coding.
- I have knowledge of kickstarting, netwokring(basic) and security STIGs.
- I know how to simply read perl and troubleshoot some basic issues.
- I am here to learn all I can while displaying it to the world.
